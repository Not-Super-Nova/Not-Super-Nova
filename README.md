### Hi, I'm Nova.

I'm a young software developer living in Suffolk, England.
Currently I mainly write Android apps in Kotlin, though I have experience with many other languages.
My goal is to provide useful code that actually makes an impact, and to get either gainful employment in software development or enough contributions and donations that I don't have to.

You can reach me at:
- nova@wittam.uk (<48hrs, encrypted)
- novawittam@pm.me (<48hrs, encrypted)
- @novaw:matrix.org (<12hrs)

Feel free to sponsor me through GitHub Sponsorships, or at [https://monzo.me/novawittam](https://monzo.me/novawittam/5.00), if you like what I'm doing.
